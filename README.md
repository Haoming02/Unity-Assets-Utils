<h1 align="center">Unity Assets Utils</h1>
<p align="right">v3.2</p>

A series of utilities that assist in making datamining Unity assets faster and simpler.

## Intro
This repo provides some tools that can trivialize some steps during the datamine process.
The tools were originally written in **Python**; the new version is now rewritten in **C#**.

> When tested on a ~2GB folder with ~2000 files, the new version is roughly **~5 times** faster than the old version.

The two versions function more or less the same, refer to the respective page for the specific details.

## Usage
You can download an executable built for x64 Windows from [Release](https://github.com/Haoming02/Unity-Assets-Utils/releases) to use it directly; 
or clone the project and build it yourself; alternatively, just use the old Python version.
